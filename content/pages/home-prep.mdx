Everyone wants their property to look its best. Here are some suggestions for getting your property ready to look its best and make the photo shoot go smoothly. Many of these things also apply to making sure your home shows well to potential buyers.  
- The photo-shoot will take approximately 2 hours.
- I will be photographing both the inside and outside of the home.
- Iâ€™ll be photographing all of the major rooms.
- I normally do not photograph the garage unless it has special features.
- If there are special features of the home that are not obvious please let me know about these so I include them in the shoot.
- Contain pets in the garage or out of sight.
- Remove all vehicles from driveways and do not park directly in front of the house.
- Move garbage cans out of sight.
- Remove all garden tools including hoses and sprinklers.
- Mow and rake yard.
- Sweep driveways, sidewalks and patios.
- Clear off counter tops in kitchen and bathroom areas.
- Remove photos, notes and papers from the refrigerator.
- Turn on all interior lights.
- Turn ceiling fans and televisions off.
- De-clutter rooms which may be excessively furnished, they do not photograph well.
- Make all beds and tidy bedrooms. Clothes should be hung, or folded and put away.
- Remove piles of newspaper and magazines.
- Tuck trash cans out of view in a closet or cupboard.
- Let me know if the home contains valuable works of art. I can edit photos to make these items unrecognizable.
