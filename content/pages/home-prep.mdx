- The photo-shoot will take approximately 2 hours.
- I will be photographing both the inside and outside of the home.
- Iâ€™ll be photographing all of the major rooms. 
- I normally do not photograph the garage unless it has special features.
- If there are special features of the home that are not obvious please let me know about these so I include them in the shoot.
- Contain pets in the garage or out of sight
- Remove all vehicles from driveways and do not park directly in front of the house.
- Move garbage cans out of sight.
- Remove all garden tools including hoses and sprinklers.
- Mow and rake yard
- Sweep driveways, sidewalks and patios
- Clear off counter tops in kitchen and bathroom areas
- Remove photos, notes and papers from the refrigerator
- Turn on all interior lights.
- Turn ceiling fans and televisions off.
- De-clutter rooms which may be excessively furnished. They do not photograph well.
- Make all beds and tidy bedrooms. Clothes should be hung, or folded and put away.
- Remove piles of newspaper and magazines.
- Tuck trash cans out of view in a closet or cupboard.
- Let me know if the home contains valuable works of art. I can edit photos to make these items unrecognizable.
