**Scheduling:** Please contact me no less than 24 hours before your preferred shoot time. The shoot will take between 1 and 2 hours, depending on size of home.

**Payment:** Payment is due at the time of the shoot. I accept credit cards as well as checks, or cash.

**The Shoot:** The homeowner or someone authorized by the homeowner (the agent) should be present at the shoot to give access to the home and to discuss any special considerations such as what should be included or excluded in shots. Our goal at the shoot is to provide 25 quality photos that include a front exterior, back exterior and all the major rooms such as living room, dining room, family room, kitchen, master bedroom, master bath and bedrooms. Powder rooms, small bathrooms, utility rooms or garages are not a shooting priority unless you give us direction otherwise.

**Pets:** Please make sure pets are contained during the shoot. Pets are never included in photos and need to be out of the way during the shoot.

**Cancellation Policy:** If cancellation or rescheduling is necessary, please give me 24 hours notice.

**Photo delivery:** Once the photos are shot they will be edited and optimized for quality and delivered to you via web site within 24 hours. You will receive an email with a link and instructions on downloading your photos. 

**Photo Rights and Usage:** All photos produced for the client may be used by that agent for all marketing associated with the current sale of the property in accordance with local MLS rules. Please note that the photos will be copyrighted by the photographer and a license granted only to the agent and NOT to any third party. # Any usage of the photos by a third party, including but not limited to architects, builders, stagers, designers, sellers or buyers is prohibited unless approved in writing by the photographer.
